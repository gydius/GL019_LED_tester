# GL019_LED_tester

A simple PCB to test SMD LEDs. Solder your SMD LEDs and add an adaquate resitor to it and you will be able to choose quickly the right couple LED/R for your next project ! 

I did it since I do have quite a lot of references of SMD LEDs in my personnal stock so I would forget what color they are. 

For time for me with sending custom panel to a manufacturer, everything went nice. Used [GitHub - ThisIsNotRocketScience/GerberTools: Tools to load/edit/create/panelizer sets of gerber files](https://github.com/ThisIsNotRocketScience/GerberTools)

# This project is still in progress !

This is the first revision, I got the PCBs from JLC and they're nice !

But there a few mistakes and changes to do for next revision : 

- Change the solderjump for a bigger one.  Might also chage by a 1x2 2.54mm connector and 2.54mm jumper. 

- Get the 0402 and 0804 LEDs on same footprint (and might also add THT LEDs)

- Same but for 0402 and 0804 SMD resistors 

- Increase the maring sikscreen area, it is currently not enough to easily write the LEDs' references on it. 

- Add silkscreen to right S/N off the PCB.

- Change the silkscreen color, the blue is definitey not wise when you want to write on it with black/blue permanent marker. Might try white FR4 with black silkscreen.
